# final-project-end-to-end-credit-card-fraud-pipeline

Credit score is an important metric for banks to rate the credit performance of their applicants. 
They use personal information and financial records of credit card applicants to predict whether these applicants will default in the future or not. 
From these predictions, the banks will then decide if they want to issue credit cards to these applicants or not. 
The banks are asking us to create an end-to-end pipeline to help them handle this problem.

#### Project Objectives
The objectives of this projects are described below:
- Create an automated pipeline to flow both batch and stream data from data sources to data warehouses and data marts.
- Create a visualization dashboard to get insights from the data, which can be used for business decisions.
- Create an infrastructure as code which makes the codes reusable and scalable for another projects.
